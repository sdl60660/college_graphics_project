# College Graphics Project (WebGL)

Final Project for EECS 351-1 in college. Uses WebGL to render a landscape with fish, snake, plants. Uses lighting/materials.

Runs pretty slow and definitely is not best practice (passing WebGL strings into javascript, rather than using a library like three.js), but was at least a good intro into graphics concepts.

Hosting the project here: http://webgl-college-project.herokuapp.com/ (because it's free and why not)
